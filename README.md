Beginning repository to understand how to create a repository using GIT

This is just a generic place for me to learn the different options that are available to GIT so that I can begin using these in a real enviornment.

My name is Michael, I have been doing .NET development since 2005 and mostly used VSS or TFS as my source cnotrol.  I am now begiinning to learn the GIT repository.  Im constantly trying to learn new things in .NET or brush up on my .NET skills to try and make my weak areas a strength.  Although I have 6 children, I am able to somehow find the time to spend each day to look into new ways of development, learn them, and implement those things into my work place quickly.
